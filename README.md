# RevsTabletV2.3Release
This is an Android app for volunteers at the Revs Institiute for Automotive Research, a non-profit museum

The app is configured with a JSON file located at https://github.com/wtnh/repo/blob/master/revs_tablet_config1.json
The target device is currently a Samsung Galaxy A 7" tablet.

Here is a brief demo (unfortunately the clicks are not visible and gif has color artifacts):
